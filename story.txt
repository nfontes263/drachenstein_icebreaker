The flughafen in Berlin was extremely busy. The klimaanlage was not working and the heat was so
intense I was burning up like a bratwurst. My friend picked me up in a BMW. Suddenly a Porsche 
pulled alongside us and began blasting Rammstein! I'm enjoying the hund lunging in the backseat.
Distracted from admiration, suddenly the hund snatched the apfelkuchen from my hand and ate it.
Defeated, I found myself seeking the local ratskeller to relieve my woes. Everyone in the ratskeller
on the hauptstrasse turned to look at me as I walked in because of my fabulous lederhosen. I knew I
was in Berline, as the smell of fresh brot was everywhere. The night was now getting late though so
it was time for me to change into my dirndel and head back to my schloss. Along the way, I passed a
wettbewerbsfaehig drinking event at a local biergarten. Just as Iâ€™m about to chug my first stein 
in the competition, a cat suddenly darts past me, chasing a bratwurst that had rolled off a nearby table.
